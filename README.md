# Occupancy-detection-with-machine-learning
Machine learning code to decide whether the room is empty or not based on the features like Temperature, Humidity, Light, CO2, HumidityRatio

The output of the Logistic funstion:
train_accuracy = 0.99
val_accuracy = 0.99
mean_squared_error between predicted and actual Y_test = 0.0075

The output of the RandomForestClassifier funstion:
train_accuracy = 1.0
val_accuracy = 1.0
mean_squared_error between predicted and actual Y_test = 0.0070
